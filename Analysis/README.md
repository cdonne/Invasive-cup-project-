### Normality test
- Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test was used for assessing normality 
- Final length:K-S statistic=0.030, df=301, p=.200
- Age at maturity:K-S statistic= .111, df=301, p<0.001 
- Growth rate: K-S statistic= 0.080, df= 301, p<0.001

### Data Transformations 
- All variables were multipled by 100 and then a box cox transformation was applied to achieve normality 

### Normality using transformed data 
- Final length: K-S statistic= 0.030, df= 301, p=.200
- Age at maturity: K-S statistic = 0.049, df= 301, p=0.083
- Growth rate: K-S statistic= 0.037, df= 301, p=.200 

### Linear regression 
- to see if growth rate was assocaited with age at maturity and final length 
- Age at maturity Rsq=0.246  p<0.001
- Final length Rsq=0.051 p<0.001
- saved residuals for age at maturity to correct for growth rate

### General linear model 
- a nested design was used to assess the differences in life history traits between invasive and native snails
- see output file for the tables 
- both growth rate and age at maturity were signficantly different between invasive and native
