### Data Transformations 
-for both the Donne and Larkin data all variables were multipled by 100 and then a box cox transformation was applied to achieve normality 

### Donne data normality 
-Kolmogorov–Smirnov (K-S) test was used for normality
-Growth rate 3mm: stat= .097 df=73 sig=.085
-Age at maturity: stat=.068 df=73 sig=.200
-Final length: stat=.076 df=73 sig=.200 

### Larkin data normality 
-Kolmogorov–Smirnov (K-S) test was used for normality 
-Growth rate 3mm: stat=.05 df=231 sig=.067
-Age at maturity: stat=.053 df=231 sig=.200
-Final length: stat=.030 df=231 sig=.200

### Linear regression 
-to see if growth rate was assocaited with age at maturity and final length 
-Final length Rsq= .026 sig=.005
-Age at maturity Rsq=.008 sig=.110 
-saved residuals for final length to correct for growth rate
