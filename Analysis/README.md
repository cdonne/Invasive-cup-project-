# Statistical Analysis

### SPSS  
- KS test was run for the variables Growth rate 3mm, Age at maturity, final length and growth rate final to see if the data is distributed normally 
- Both growth rate 3mm and final length fail to reject the null hypothesis p>0.05
- Age at maturity and growth rate final have p<.05. I think I will have to do a natural log transformation for these variables since they aren't distributed normally.  
- did a log transformation (log 10) for age at maturity. p-value is .200 so the data is distrubted normally. 
### SAS

- created a box plot for final length comparing for each population. Looking at the median it seems PA has the greatest final length but will need to verify that with descriptive statistics. Again, I need to ask about the dead snails or not yet mature snails. 

- it is intersting that Pc seems to have the fastest growth rate but has highly variable final lengths. I will need to think about this more and see what the descriptive statistics show
